Analyzing Adidas sales data.

## Purpose:
As times change and the world moves to be more online, companies like Adidas need to pay close attention to customer behavior. Adidas needs to analyze their sales data to determine where, when, and how their customers are buying Adidas products in order to optimize marketing, inventory, and future plans. 

This project aims to identify key performance indicators and trends in Adidas's sales data in order to make recommendations on areas of need and potential. 

## Methodology: 

### Data Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset)

### Excel:
This analyis project was completed in Microsoft Excel. 

The product column was separated into two separate columns: one for the "gender" of the item and the other for the item itself. 

Pivot tables and pivot charts were made from the data to identify KPIs. 

Related pivot charts were combined in order to form dashboards. Slicers were added to the dashboards in order to better analyze the data. Users can filter the data by the "gender", region, and/or the retailer.
